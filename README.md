# Bussines Problem:

''''
One of the most important problems in e-commerce is the correct calculation of the points
given to the products after sales. The solution to this problem means providing greater
customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, prominence of the product for the sellers
and a seamless shopping experience for the buyers. Another problem is the correct ordering
of the comments given to the products. The prominence of misleading comments will cause both
financial loss and loss of customers. In the solution of these 2 basic problems, while the
e-commerce site and the sellers will increase their sales, the customers will complete the
purchasing journey without any problems.
